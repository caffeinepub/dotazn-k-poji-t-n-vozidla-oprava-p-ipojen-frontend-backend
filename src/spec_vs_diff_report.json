  "summary": "REQ-1 is not implemented: the actor creation flow still calls initializeAccessControl() without handling the case where access control is already initialized, so actor initialization can still fail and prevent admin form submission. Additionally, an unrequested project_state.json file was added (and a large unrelated frontend-file-summaries.txt update appears unrelated to the requested minimal fix).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Update the frontend actor creation flow so that if initializeAccessControl() (or _initializeAccessControlWithSecret(...)) throws because access control is already initialized, the error is handled and the actor is still returned/usable (so /admin form submission can call createForm without a \"not connected to backend\" error).",
      "reason": "The updated actor hook still performs an unconditional `await actor.initializeAccessControl();` without any try/catch or conditional handling for the \"already initialized\" error case. This means actor creation can still fail if the backend reports access control is already initialized.",
